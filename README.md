# N-Body-Gravitational-Simulation
This code is used to simulate N-number of bodies that are under the influence of gravitational forces caused by each body.
It includes the following analytical methods to simulate motions of the bodies: First principles (SUVAT), Euler method, Semi-implicit Euler method, 4th order Runge-Kutta method.
