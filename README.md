# N-Body-Gravitational-Simulation

## Outline
This code is used to simulate N-number of bodies that are under the influence of gravitational forces caused by each body.

Several methods to simulate the motions of the bodies can be chosen: First Principles, Euler, Semi-Implicit Euler, 4th order Runge-Kutta.
